# Project: Legislative Topic Tagging
Author: Jehan Bugli

## Overview

This project aims to automate policy area categorization for congressional bills.
It includes scripts for data collection, training, and inference.

This project uses a src layout, where all the code sits!
The module structure (within src) is as follows:

- data_collection: modules for downloading and processing bulk data
    - bulk_data.py: initial collection steps for bill data
    - parsing.py: retrieving bill text contents for use
    - policy_areas.py: collecting policy area tags for use
    - utils/downloads.py: a download utility used in other files for loading XML

- training: modules coordinating training efforts
    - train.py: executes grid searches and saves model artifacts

- app: modules for inference and Streamlit app construction
    - app.py: app construction and execution

- cli: CLI scripts (defined in pyproject.toml) for convenience
    - get_data.py: coordinates bulk data downloads -> tabular input data
    - train_model.py: executes model training
    - run_app.py: runs the Streamlit app

Some important files remain outside of src:

- pyproject.toml: Specifies dependencies, CLI scripts, etc.
- uv.lock: A file generated by the uv package manager to lock dependency versions.
